# TPSA-Quantum-Workshops
Beginning in 2022 the Theoretical Physics Student Association(https://tpsa.ie/) has taught a summer series of workshops to enable undergraduate students to be introduced to specialist topics in physics, such as machine learning, quantum computing and Monte Carlo methods.\
In each series of these workshops I have taught a workshop focused on quantum computing, covering the core ideas behind it, how to numerically use these ideas in Qiskit(https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) and specifically studying particular algorithms or applications.\
Contained in this repository are the teaching materials I have used in each of these workshops.
